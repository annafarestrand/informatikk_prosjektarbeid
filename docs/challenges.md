## Missing test for REST-Server

### Challenge:

While developing our application with a Spring Boot REST server, our team struggled to create tests for the server, du to springboot taking more time than accounted for.

### Strategy:

To address this challenge, we tried to debugg to identify the root cause. As the deadline neared, we prioritized completing the final documentation.

### Reflection:

In hindsight, postponing making the tests for the server may not have been the most optimal choice. We now realize the importance of seeking additional resources and technical assistance, like consulting teaching assistants or relevant documentation. This experience emphasized the value of proactive problem-solving and using available resources. Going forward, we've learned to allocate more time for troubleshooting, seek assistance early, and prioritize enduring solutions over temporary workarounds.

## Uanable to verify shippable product

### Challenge:

We have followed given instructions for making a shippable product. We have no way to verify this as none of the group members has a computer that is able to run WIX tools.

### Strategy:

Our strategy is to hope that the shippable product works.

### Reflection:

If we could redo this, we would have asked on of the TAs if they could verify the shippable product for us.
